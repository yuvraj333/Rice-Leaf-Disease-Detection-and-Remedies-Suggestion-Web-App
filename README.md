# Rice Leaf Disease Detection and Remedies Suggestion Web App

This web application provides a solution for detecting diseases in rice leaves and suggesting remedies using machine learning models. The app allows users to upload images of rice leaves, and it identifies potential diseases using deep learning techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), ResNet50, VGG19, and VGG16. Based on the detected disease, the app also suggests remedies for the user.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: 
  - HTML5
  - CSS3
  - JavaScript

- **Backend**:
  - Python with Flask
  - RESTful API for communication

- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
  - ResNet50
  - VGG19
  - VGG16

- **Mobile App**:
  - Flutter
  - Firebase
  - API Integration for Web App Communication

## Features

- **Disease Detection**: Users can upload images of rice leaves, and the app detects diseases using deep learning models (CNN, ResNet50, VGG19, VGG16).
- **Remedies Suggestion**: Based on the detected disease, the app provides remedies and solutions to treat the diseases.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Simple and responsive design for both mobile and web users.
- **Mobile App Integration**: The mobile app, built with Flutter and Firebase, is fully integrated with the web app via API calls.

## How It Works

### Frontend (Web App)

The web app interface allows users to upload images of rice leaves. The image is then processed and sent to the backend via API. The backend, powered by Flask and the trained machine learning models (ResNet50, VGG19, VGG16), processes the image and returns the predicted disease. The frontend displays the result along with suggested remedies.

### Backend (Flask API)

The backend leverages deep learning models (CNN, ResNet50, VGG19, VGG16) to process the uploaded image. The models are pre-trained on a dataset of rice leaf diseases and can detect common diseases like bacterial blight, leaf blast, and more. Once the disease is detected, the backend fetches the corresponding remedy and returns it to the frontend.

### Mobile App

The mobile app built with Flutter connects to the web appâ€™s API, allowing users to interact with the disease detection and remedy suggestion features. Firebase is used for user authentication, data storage, and push notifications.

## API Documentation

The API allows communication between the mobile and web applications. Below is a sample of the endpoints:

### 1. **POST /upload**

- **Description**: Upload a rice leaf image for disease detection.
- **Request Body**:
  - `image`: (required) Base64-encoded image of the rice leaf.
  
- **Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "disease": "Bacterial Blight",
    "remedies": "Use copper-based fungicides and remove infected leaves."
  }
  ```

### 2. **GET /diseases**

- **Description**: Get a list of known diseases.
- **Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "diseases": ["Bacterial Blight", "Leaf Blast", "Rice Sheath Blight"]
  }
  ```
